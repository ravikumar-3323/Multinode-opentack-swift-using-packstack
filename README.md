OpenStack Swift, commonly referred to as just "Swift," is an open-source object storage system designed to store and retrieve large amounts of unstructured data. It is part of the larger OpenStack cloud computing platform, which is a set of software tools for building and managing public and private clouds. OpenStack Swift is used to store and manage data at a massive scale, making it suitable for cloud storage and content delivery applications.

Key features of OpenStack Swift include:

Object Storage: Swift is an object storage system, meaning it stores data as objects rather than in a traditional file hierarchy. Each object consists of data, metadata (user-defined and system-generated), and a unique identifier (the object's name). This architecture allows for highly scalable and distributed storage.

Distributed and Redundant Architecture: Swift is designed to operate across multiple nodes (servers) in a cluster. This distributed architecture ensures that data is replicated across different nodes, providing fault tolerance and high availability. If a node fails, the data can still be accessed from other replicas.

Scalability: Swift is built to scale horizontally, meaning you can add more storage nodes to the cluster as your storage needs grow. This allows you to handle massive amounts of data and traffic.

Data Integrity and Consistency: Swift ensures data integrity by running checksums on stored objects. If data corruption is detected, Swift can retrieve a good copy from a replica. It also provides strong consistency, meaning that once an object is written, subsequent reads will always return the same data.

API Access: Swift provides a RESTful API that allows developers to interact with the storage system programmatically. This API enables users to upload, download, and manage objects, as well as set metadata and access control policies.

Data Replication and Erasure Coding: Swift supports data replication for high availability, where objects are copied across multiple nodes. It also offers erasure coding as an alternative, which enables more efficient storage by distributing data and parity information across different nodes.

Multi-tenancy: OpenStack Swift supports multi-tenancy, allowing different users or projects to share the same storage cluster while keeping their data isolated and secure.

Use cases for OpenStack Swift include cloud storage services, data backup and archiving, content delivery networks (CDNs), and large-scale data analytics, among others.

As an open-source project, OpenStack Swift benefits from contributions from a global community of developers, ensuring continuous improvements, security updates, and support for various use cases. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, making it free to use and modify.
